# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

My game will set-up a situation then ask the player a question. The player will be given two options to respond to. Depending on the
response the game will either add more or tae away (probabbly take away) healthpoints. The player starts with 100 health points and
needs to get to the end of the game before running out of healthpoints.I tried to make the situations as funny as I could and added a
few other video game references.
